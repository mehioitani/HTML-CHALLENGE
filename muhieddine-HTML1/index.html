<p>The BMW M3 (E30) was presented to the world public at the international motor show in Frankfurt in 1985. It was primarily used for homologation for the German Touring Car Championship (DTM). However, the demand was so great from the start that it was manufactured and sold in far larger numbers than originally planned.</p>
